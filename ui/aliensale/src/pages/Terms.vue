      <h2 class="short-hr-left"><span class="colored">6. Virtual Items, Trilium, NFTs</span></h2>

      <h3>6.1 General rule</h3>

Such Virtual Items may be modified, replaced, altered or removed by Dacoco at any time under Section 10 of this Agreement, whether or not they were purchased for consideration or obtained as part of the gameplay. </p>

      <h3>6.2 Trilium</h3>

      <p>Dacoco may from time to time offer "Trilium" for purchase or as an award for certain achievements within Alien Worlds' gameplay in accordance with the procedures and further terms specified within Dacoco's sole discretion. Units of Trilium may be issued as tokens issued on the WAX Blockchain or otherwise as Blockchain based tokens and may used to pay for certain other Virtual Items, advantages and services within or in connection with Alien Worlds, as may be offered from time to time. Trilium may be purchased within the Services using a credit card (or other payment means accepted by us, such as a debit card, prepaid payment card, or a promotional code or gift card) or other cryptocurrency.

Trilium does not constitute personal property, has no cash value, and has no value outside of Alien Worlds and/or the Services. Other than within the gameplay of Alien Worlds, Trilium may not be transferred or sold to any other person.</p>

      <h3>6.3 NFTs</h3>

      <p>Notwithstanding the above, Alien Worlds' gameplay allows its users to own certain specific virtual assets, as Dacoco may design and release, within its sole discretion, from time to time, in form of non-fungible tokens issued on the WAX Blockchain or otherwise as Blockchain based tokens, as well as the underlying smart contracts ("NFTs"). NFTs may, but do not have to, be designed as digital collectibles and/or items with a function within Alien Worlds' gameplay. Such NFTs are subject to the following policy: </p>

      <h3>Distribution of NFTs:</h3>

      <p>NFTs can be earned within Alien Worlds in accordance with the smart contracts’ functionality, as may be determined at the sole discretion of Dacoco, from time to time. In addition, Dacoco may at any time, but has no obligation to, offer NFTs for sale or otherwise distribute NFTs in such process and pursuant to such terms as Dacoco may determine within its sole discretion. This includes, without limitation, the right to provide NFTs at no charge to any individual user of group of users of Alien Worlds, the Website, Materials and/or Services or to third parties. Unless otherwise agreed with Dacoco in writing, users of Alien Words, including the End User, have no preferential subscription rights or similar rights in connection with any issuance and/or distribution of NFTs by Dacoco.</p>

      <h3>Purchase of NFTs:</h3>

      <p>To purchase NFTs, you must have (i) an active User Account and (ii) an active WAX compatible digital wallet (a WAX-Account). Dacoco reserves the right, at its sole discretion, not to offer or to cease to offer NFTs for your purchase or to restrict your NFT purchases. NFTs may only be purchased at such purchase price and any NFTs available for purchase may only be purchased by such means and in accordance with such further terms and conditions as Dacoco may specify at its sole discretion from time to time.</p>

      <h3>Transfer of NFTs:</h3>
      <p>NFTs are not designed to be transferred other than within and as required by the gameplay of Alien Worlds. Dacoco reserves the right to subject the transfer of NFTs to a dedicated transfer policy, as drafted up at Dacoco's sole discretion (an "NFT Transfer Policy"). Any applicable NFT Transfer Policy, as in force from time to time, shall be made available on the Website. </p>

      <p>You acknowledge and understand that your transactions on the WAX platform are public and that your WAX address will be associated with these transactions. You further acknowledge and accept that you will be solely liable for any fees, costs, deductions or expenses associated with your transactions on the WAX platform. After an NFT is initially sold or otherwise released or put into circulation by us, we have no control over subsequent transactions. Accordingly, we will have no liability to you (or anyone else) as a result of any transactions that you engage in with respect to NFTs.</p>

      <h3>Risks related to the nature of the NFTs:</h3>

      <p>NFTs are subject to certain inherent risks, in particular because NFTs may be based or enabled by the Atomic Assets Smart Contract on the WAX Blockchain (or any successor digital item standard). These risks include, inter alia, the following, which you acknowledge and accept to solely bear when acquiring, holding, managing, using, selling and/or otherwise alienating NFTs:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>i) There may not be a market with a sufficient number of potential buyers and sellers of NFTs. NFTs may therefore not be liquid and you may not be able to effectively resell NFTs you have acquired. We make no representations or warranties that NFTs can effectively be resold.</li>

        <li>ii) NFTs may not have a use other than within Alien Worlds, if at all.</li>

        <li>iii) The value of an NFT may be volatile. Virtual currencies and assets can be very volatile and impact the value of NFTs. We make no representations or warranties that any NFTs will retain increase their value. You might lose money.</li>

        <li>iv) The WAX platform may subject your ability to purchase, hold, manage, use sell, and/or otherwise alienate NFTs to costs, fees, deductions or expenses, which you hereby agree to fully and solely bear.</li>

        <li>v) The WAX platform may not function properly and may be subject to hacking, malicious software, interruptions and failures. These events may cause delays or failures in your ability to purchase, hold, manage, use sell, or otherwise alienate NFTs.</li>

        <li>vi) Atomic Assets accounts may not function properly and may be subject to hacking, malicious software, interruptions and failures. These events may cause delays or failures in your ability to purchase, hold, manage, use sell, or otherwise alienate NFTs.</li>

        <li>vii) Laws may apply in certain jurisdictions and new regulations could be enacted that might limit or require changes to the functionality enabled by the WAX platform, which could impact and/or impede on your ability to purchase, hold, manage, use sell, or otherwise alienate NFTs.</li>

        <li>viii) Other changes to the WAX platform could impact and/or impede on your ability to purchase, hold, manage, use sell, or otherwise alienate NFTs.</li></ul>

      <h3>6.4 Withdrawal right</h3>

      <p>In the event of a Ban resulting in the termination of this Agreement or if this Agreement is otherwise terminated following a breach by the End User, Dacoco shall have the right, without notice, explanation or liability, to withdraw or otherwise request the transfer to Dacoco or such third party as Dacoco may determine within its sole discretion (call option), of (i) all or individual NFTs and/or (ii) all or individual units of Trilium from the End User and to retransfer such NFTs, against such consideration (if any) as Dacoco may deem appropriate within its sole discretion, to itself or third parties.</p>

      <h3>6.5 Loss of access</h3>

      <p>If Dacoco's withdrawal right is not exercised in connection with a Termination of this agreement, the End User shall retain ownership of their NFTs and their units of Trilium. The End User acknowledges and accepts that they may not be able to access, use, benefit from, transfer and/or otherwise dispose of such NFTs and/or units of Trilium following a termination of this Agreement. To the greatest extent permitted by law and without limiting the generality of Section 14, Dacoco shall neither have any liability for any damage resulting from such loss of access, nor any obligation to refund the purchase price paid for the relevant NFTs and/or units of Trilium to the End User.</p>

      <h2 class="short-hr-left"><span class="colored">7. Compliance</span></h2>

      <p>You acknowledge that certain operations in respect of the NFTs, in particular, without limitation, the transfer of NFTs to third parties, may constitute and/or otherwise fall within the scope of regulated activities under applicable laws in certain jurisdictions. You acknowledge that you may not use Alien Worlds to engage into any such activities and that Dacoco makes no representation in respect of, or otherwise in connection with, the suitability of Alien Worlds and/or any output generated by using Alien Worlds, to engage into any regulated activity or Alien Worlds' or such output's compliance with laws and regulations applicable to such activities. Dacoco neither recommends, nor otherwise advises that you engage in such activities. If you choose to engage in regulated activities, you do so at your own risk and sole responsibility. </p>
